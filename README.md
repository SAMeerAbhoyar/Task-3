# Task-3: Linear Regression

**Objective:**  
Implement and understand both simple and multiple linear regression on a dataset and analyze model performance.

**Tools Used:**  
Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Dataset:**  
Housing.csv containing features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and price.

**Steps Followed:**  
1. Loaded and explored the dataset.  
2. Performed a simple linear regression model using area as the only feature.  
3. Performed a multiple linear regression model using area, bedrooms, and bathrooms as input features.  
4. Split the dataset into train-test sets for both models.  
5. Trained both models using LinearRegression from Scikit-learn.  
6. Evaluated models using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² score.  
7. Plotted the regression line for simple linear regression.

**Final Result:**  
Successfully built and evaluated simple and multiple regression models, analyzed prediction performance, and extracted feature importance from model coefficients.
